Syntax,Explanation
int<lower=1> N;,N is an integer (int) and cannot be lower than 1
int y[N];,"y contains N integers and y is an array (arrays are different from vectors and matrices, which are limited to one and two dimensions, respectively)"
"int<lower=1,upper=J> id[N];",id contains N integers that must be between 1 and J (where J is also an integer)
1:(K-1),"produces a sequence of integers between 1 and K-1 (e.g., if K is 6 the result would be [1,2,3,4,5])"
"matrix[N, 2] X;",X is a matrix with N rows and 2 columns
vector[N] sig_trial;,sig_trial is a vector of N numbers
real b_d[J];,b_d is an array of J numbers that can take any value
real<lower=0> tau_d;,tau_d is a single number that can take any value of 0 or greater
for (i in 1:N){ … },produce a sequence of integers between 1 and N and for each integer (I) in this sequence run the code between the braces (note i is often used by convention but doesn’t have to be)
x = 1;,x is assigned the value of 1
"x ~ normal(0, 1);",x is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
"b[i] = dot_product(X[i,], B_b) ",the element of b in position i is equal to the dot product of row i of matrix X and B_d
b_b[id[i]];,find the id of the participant that observation i comes from (id[i]) and use this to select the value of b_b corresponding to that id
y[i] ~ categorical(theta[i]);,element i of y is sampled from a categorical distribution with probabilities determined by element i of theta
